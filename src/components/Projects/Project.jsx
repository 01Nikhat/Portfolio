            <h3>Food Restaurant Website</h3>
            <p>I have developed a fully functional food restaurant website with distinct interfaces â€“ one for users and another for admin management. Built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend, it ensures a seamless user experience. The admin interface allows managing products by adding or deleting them and updating order statuses, such as changing 'Food Processing' to 'Out for Delivery.' Additionally, I implemented and tested a payment method for secure transactions and integrated an email feature for notifications. </p>
